# Profile Capture Process Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Input Priority Issue ✅
**Problem**: When users were in profile completion flow and entered inputs like "Ak" or "akash jadhav", the system was treating them as casual chat instead of profile input.

**Solution**: Reordered priority handling in `authenticatedUserController.js`:
- Profile field updates now have PRIORITY 1 (highest)
- AI intent handling moved to PRIORITY 4
- Added check to prevent casual chat handling during profile updates

### 2. Duplicate "Hi" Response Issue ✅
**Problem**: When user typed "hi", they received multiple responses.

**Solution**: 
- Added `profile_completion_started` flag check
- Only trigger profile completion flow once per session
- Added explicit greeting word detection

### 3. Smart Input Recognition ✅

#### Gender Field
**Before**: Only accepted 1, 2, or 3
**After**: Now accepts:
- Numbers: 1, 2, 3
- Full text: male, female, others
- Short forms: m, f
- Variations: man, woman, lady, transgender, non-binary
- Partial matches: "mal" → Male, "fem" → Female

#### Yes/No Fields
**Before**: Only YES/NO
**After**: Now accepts:
- English: yes, no, y, n, yeah, nope, sure, okay
- Numbers: 1 (yes), 0 (no)
- Indian languages: haan, nahi, ji, na
- Other variations: definitely, absolutely, never

#### Professional Role & Multiple Choice
**Before**: Only numbers
**After**: Now accepts:
- Numbers: 1, 2, 3...
- Text: "entrepreneur", "student", "consultant"
- Partial text (3+ chars): "entre" → Entrepreneur, "stud" → Student

### 4. Name Validation Flexibility ✅
**Before**: Rejected short names like "Ak"
**After**: 
- Accepts 2+ character names
- Removed overly strict fake name detection
- Now allows legitimate short names/nicknames

## Testing Examples

User inputs that now work:
- "yes", "y", "1", "yeah", "sure", "haan" → YES
- "no", "n", "0", "nope", "nahi" → NO
```
