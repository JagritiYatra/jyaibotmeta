# Location-Specific Search Implementation

## Overview
The JyAibot now supports advanced location-specific searches that allow users to find alumni based on both their expertise/role AND their location using natural language queries.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Query Pattern Recognition
The system recognizes location-specific queries using the pattern: `<search_term> from <location>`

Examples:
- "web developers from bengaluru"
- "AI experts from Mumbai"
- "entrepreneurs from delhi"

### 2. AND Query Logic
Location-specific searches use MongoDB's `$and` operator to ensure results match BOTH criteria:

```javascript
{
  $and: [
    // Location condition
    {
      $or: [
        { 'basicProfile.linkedinScrapedData.location': { $regex: location, $options: 'i' } },
        { 'enhancedProfile.currentAddress': { $regex: location, $options: 'i' } },
        { 'enhancedProfile.country': { $regex: location, $options: 'i' } }
      ]
    },
    // Search term condition
    {
      $or: [
        { 'basicProfile.linkedinScrapedData.headline': { $regex: keyword, $options: 'i' } },
        { 'basicProfile.linkedinScrapedData.skills': { $regex: keyword, $options: 'i' } },
        { 'basicProfile.about': { $regex: keyword, $options: 'i' } },
        { 'enhancedProfile.professionalRole': { $regex: keyword, $options: 'i' } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Session Persistence
Search results are now stored in session with:
- Original query context
- Search intent
- User ID (converted to string for consistency)
- Timestamp (30-minute expiry)

### 4. Follow-up Query Support
Users can refine their searches with follow-up queries:
- "more matches from bengaluru" - filters existing results by location
- "show more" - displays next batch of results
- "contact details" - shows email/LinkedIn for displayed profiles

## Key Files Modified

1. **src/services/enhancedSearchService.js**
   - Added `buildSearchQuery` method with location-specific logic
   - Enhanced intent extraction to recognize location patterns
   - Improved result storage with query context

2. **src/services/intelligentContextService.js**
   - Fixed userId consistency (ObjectId to string conversion)
   - Enhanced `handleFollowUpQuery` for location-specific follow-ups
   - Added query context storage in `storeSearchResults`

3. **src/controllers/authenticatedUserControllerSimple.js**
   - Improved query type detection
   - Enhanced self-reflection with actual user data
   - Better handling of follow-up queries

## Usage Examples

### Basic Location Search
```
User: "show me web developers from bengaluru"
Bot: [Shows only developers located in Bengaluru]
```

### Follow-up Location Filter
```
User: "developers"
Bot: [Shows various developers]
User: "more matches from pune"
Bot: [Filters to show only Pune developers]
```

### Complex Queries
```
User: "AI ML experts from Hyderabad"
Bot: [Shows only AI/ML experts located in Hyderabad]
```

## Testing
Use the test script at `/test-search.js` to verify functionality:
```bash
node test-search.js
```

## Error Handling
- No results: Provides helpful message suggesting different keywords
- Invalid location: Falls back to general search
- Session expired: Prompts user to search again

## Performance Considerations
- Results limited to 100 per query
- Session data expires after 30 minutes
- Location matching is case-insensitive
- Multiple location fields checked for better coverage
