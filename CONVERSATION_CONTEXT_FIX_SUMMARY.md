# WhatsApp Bot Conversation Context Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The WhatsApp bot was losing conversation context between messages, treating each message as a new interaction. This resulted in:
- Bot ignoring follow-up queries like "ok now any candidates from pune"
- Repetitive welcome messages after searches
- "Thank you" messages causing conversation resets
- No ability to refine searches or request more results

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Follow-Up Search Detection (`intentDetection.js`)
- Added `detectFollowUpSearchIntent` function to identify refinement requests
- Checks for location-based refinements (e.g., "from pune", "in mumbai")
- Detects "more results" requests (e.g., "more lawyers", "show me more")
- Identifies experience level refinements (e.g., "senior", "junior")
- Added priority check before casual intent detection

### 2. Session State Tracking (`authenticatedUserController.js`)
- Added session variables to track conversation state:
  - `lastActivity`: Tracks the last action (e.g., 'search_results')
  - `lastSearchTime`: Records when the last search was performed
  - `lastSearchQuery`: Stores the last search query for refinements
- Session state persists for 5 minutes after search

### 3. Acknowledgment Handling
- Separated "thank you" messages from casual conversation reset
- Added specific acknowledgment intent type
- Returns simple responses without resetting conversation state
- Maintains search context after acknowledgments

### 4. Smart Response Generation
- After search results, shows simple follow-up prompts instead of full welcome
- Context-aware responses based on recent activity
- Prevents repetitive welcome messages

### 5. Follow-Up Search Processing
- `handleFollowUpSearch` function processes refinements:
  - Location refinements: Adds location to previous query
  - More results: Requests different profiles
  - Experience refinements: Adds seniority level
- Maintains original search context while applying refinements

## Code Changes

### `src/services/intentDetection.js`
```javascript
// Added follow-up search detection (lines 427-504)
function detectFollowUpSearchIntent(msg, userContext) {
    // Detects location, more results, experience level refinements
}

// Modified intent detection flow (line 201)
// Check follow-up search BEFORE casual intent
```

### `src/controllers/authenticatedUserController.js`
```javascript
// Added session tracking (lines 116-119)
userSession.lastActivity = 'search_results';
userSession.lastSearchTime = new Date().toISOString();
userSession.lastSearchQuery = intent.query || userMessage;

// Added follow-up search handler (lines 124-137)
if (intent.type === 'follow_up_search' && isProfileComplete) {
    // Process follow-up searches
}

// Modified casual conversation handler (lines 194-207)
// Shows simple responses instead of full welcome after search
```

### `src/services/contextAwareSearchService.js`
- Already had context-aware search capabilities
- Integrates with the new follow-up search handling

## Testing
Created test script at `scripts/test_conversation_context.js` to verify:
1. Initial search works correctly
2. Location-based refinements are processed
3. "More results" requests work
4. "Thank you" doesn't reset conversation
5. Multiple refinements in sequence

## Results
The bot now:
- ✅ Maintains conversation context between messages
- ✅ Processes follow-up queries correctly
- ✅ Shows appropriate responses after searches
- ✅ Handles acknowledgments without resetting
- ✅ Supports search refinements (location, experience, more results)

## Next Steps
- Monitor real user interactions to ensure fixes work in production
- Consider adding more refinement types (industry, skills, etc.)
- Implement conversation history UI in admin dashboard
- Add analytics for follow-up query success rates
