# Search Flow Test - Improved UX

## Test Scenario: Chemical Engineering Domain Search

### Flow 1: General Knowledge ‚Üí Domain Search

**User**: what is chemical engineering

**Bot** (via GeneralQuestionService):
```
Chemical engineering combines chemistry, physics, and mathematics to design industrial processes.
It focuses on converting raw materials into useful products like fuels, plastics, and medicines.
Chemical engineers work in industries including pharmaceuticals, energy, and manufacturing.
They optimize production processes for efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability.
Key skills include process design, thermodynamics, and materials science knowledge.

**Alumni who might help:**
‚Ä¢ John Doe - Chemical engineer with 10+ years in pharmaceutical manufacturing
‚Ä¢ Jane Smith - Process optimization expert in petrochemical industry
```

**User**: can you help to find someone from this domain

**Bot** (via UnifiedIntelligenceService ‚Üí Search):
```
üîç Searching for "chemical engineering" experts...

```

### Flow 2: Typo Correction in Search

**User**: any chemical enignerring in the list

**Bot** (searchService with typo correction):
```
üîç Searching for "chemical engineering"... (corrected from: "chemical enignerring")

[Shows relevant chemical engineering profiles]
```

### Flow 3: Conversational Search Variations

**User**: find someone who knows about chemicals

**Bot**: [Shows chemical engineering and chemistry experts]

**User**: anyone from this field in mumbai

**Bot**: [Shows chemical engineering experts specifically from Mumbai]

**User**: show me more

**Bot**: [Shows additional chemical engineering profiles]

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Context-Aware Search
- UnifiedIntelligenceService extracts domain/topic from previous messages
- "this domain", "this field", "from there" references are understood
- Follow-up searches maintain context

### 2. Typo Correction
- Common misspellings automatically corrected
- "enignerring" ‚Üí "engineering"
- "chemcial" ‚Üí "chemical"
- "fintec" ‚Üí "fintech"

### 3. Conversational Patterns
- Natural language queries supported
- "can you help find someone..."
- "any X in the list"
- "is there anyone who..."

### 4. Fallback Search
- For profile-complete users, unclear queries attempt search
- Questions with "?" are considered potential searches
- Prevents generic welcome loop

### 5. Intent Priority
- Profile updates have highest priority
- Search intents properly detected even in conversational form
- AI understands context from last 3 messages

## Testing Checklist

- [x] General knowledge ‚Üí domain search flow
- [x] Typo correction in searches
- [x] Conversational search patterns
- [x] Follow-up searches with context
- [x] Location-based refinements
