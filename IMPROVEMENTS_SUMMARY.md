# JyAibot Improvements Summary - July 26, 2025

## Search Relevance Improvements

### 1. UI/UX Designer Search Accuracy
**Problem**: Searching for "UI UX designer from pune" showed lawyers and physiotherapists
**Solution**: 
- Added AI instruction to return "SKIP_PROFILE" for non-matching profiles
- Filter out irrelevant results before showing to user
- Re-number results after filtering

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// AI Prompt enhancement
"1. CRITICAL: If this person does NOT match the search query "${query}", respond with "SKIP_PROFILE""

// Result filtering
if (summary === 'SKIP_PROFILE' || summary.includes('SKIP_PROFILE')) {
  return null; // Will be filtered out
}

// Re-numbering after filter
const numberedResults = validResults.map((summary, index) => `${index + 1}. ${summary}`);
```

### 2. Follow-up Query Understanding
**Problem**: "tell me more about her" returning "No more results"
**Solution**:
- Enhanced query detection to properly identify pronoun-based follow-ups
- Added specific handling for "tell me more about (her|him|them)"
- Separated follow-up detection from new search detection

### 3. Single Name Search Support
**Problem**: Single names like "kirtana" or "ishita" not triggering search
**Solution**:
```javascript
// Check for single name queries
if (/^[a-z]+$/i.test(message.trim()) && message.length > 3 && message.length < 20) {
  return 'search_alumni';
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Query Detection
**Problem**: "i want to know more about ishita khond" not searching properly
**Solution**:
- Added pattern: `/know.*about.*[a-z]+/i`
- Enhanced search detection for various phrasings

### 5. Better Error Messages
**Problem**: Confusing messages when all results filtered out
**Solution**: Clear message when no matches found after filtering:
```
"No alumni found matching your specific criteria. Try broadening your search or using different keywords."
```

## Impact
- UI/UX searches now show ONLY actual designers
- Pronoun follow-ups work correctly
- Single name searches are supported
- More natural language queries are understood
- Users get more relevant results

## Testing
Test these scenarios:
1. "UI UX designer from pune" - Should show only actual designers
2. "ishita" then "tell me more about her" - Should show details
3. "kirtana" - Should search for the name
4. "i want to know more about [name]" - Should search and show details
