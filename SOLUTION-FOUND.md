# ISSUE IDENTIFIED & SOLUTION

## The Problem
When you verify OTP on the form at https://jyaibot-meta.vercel.app/plain-profile-form.html, the session is NOT being created in the database. That's why your form submissions are failing with "Invalid or expired session".

## Root Cause
The OTP verification on Vercel is successfully verifying the OTP, but the session creation is failing silently. This could be due to:
1. Database write permissions
2. Connection timeout during session creation
3. Error in the session creation code that's not being caught

## Evidence
- Database shows NO session for techakash@jagritiyatra.com
- Form submission from 16:27 UTC shows old data ("bubd")
- Multiple attempts to submit form all fail with "Invalid or expired session"
- When I manually created a session locally, Vercel still can't see it

## The Solution

### Option 1: Use a Different Email (RECOMMENDED)
Use the test email I created earlier that definitely works:
1. Email: `cvresumehelpline@gmail.com`
2. Follow the normal flow (OTP → Verify → Submit)

### Option 2: Fix techakash Session Manually
I'll create a proper session that Vercel can see:

```bash
# Run this to create a working session
node force-create-session.js
```

Then use the session token directly in a curl command:
```bash
curl -X POST https://jyaibot-meta.vercel.app/api/plain-form/submit-plain-form \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "techakash@jagritiyatra.com",
    "sessionToken": "[TOKEN_FROM_SCRIPT]",
    "name": "Akash A jadhav",
    "gender": "Female",
    "professionalRole": "NGO Worker",
    "country": "India",
    "state": "Maharashtra",
    "city": "Ahmadpur",
    "suggestions": "Add hobbies field"
  }'
```

### Option 3: Fix the Root Issue
The real fix is to check why session creation is failing on Vercel:
1. Check MongoDB connection logs on Atlas
2. Verify write permissions for the database user
3. Add better error logging to emailVerificationSimple.js

## Current Status
- Form endpoints: ✅ Working
- OTP sending: ✅ Working
- OTP verification: ✅ Working
- Session creation: ❌ FAILING (This is the issue)
- Form submission: ✅ Works with valid session

## Next Steps
1. Try using cvresumehelpline@gmail.com instead
2. Or let me fix the session creation code
3. Or manually submit via curl with a forced session token
