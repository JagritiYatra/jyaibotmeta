# Query Detection Fixes Summary - July 26, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "do you know kirtana" Not Searching
**Problem**: Getting generic response instead of searching for person
**Fix**: Added specific pattern detection
```javascript
// Check for "do you know X" pattern
if (/do you know\s+[a-z]+/i.test(message)) {
  return 'search_alumni';
}
```

### 2. "ishita ?" Not Working
**Problem**: Question mark and space breaking single name detection
**Fix**: Enhanced regex to handle punctuation
```javascript
// Check for single name queries (e.g., "ishita", "kirtana", "ishita ?")
if (/^[a-z]+\s*\??\s*$/i.test(message.trim()) && 
    message.trim().replace(/[?\s]/g, '').length > 3 && 
    message.trim().replace(/[?\s]/g, '').length < 20) {
  return 'search_alumni';
}
```

### 3. "anything more" Follow-up
**Problem**: Not recognized as follow-up query
**Fix**: Added to both query detection and follow-up handler
```javascript
// In query detection
if (/^(show more|tell me more about (her|him|them)|more details|more about|contact details|email|linkedin|next|another|any more|anything more|more matches|give.*more|where.*matches|show.*matches)/i.test(message)) {
  return 'follow_up';
}

// In follow-up handler
const wantsMore = /more|next|another|other|any more|anything more|give.*more|additional/i.test(query);
```

### 4. "best candidate" Query
**Problem**: Not triggering search
**Fix**: Added pattern to search detection
```javascript
/best.*candidate|top.*yatri/i
```

### 5. "any content creators" Query
**Problem**: Getting generic response
**Fix**: Added specific pattern for "any [profession]" queries
```javascript
/content creators?|^any\s+(content|developer|designer|founder|entrepreneur|professional|expert)/i
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ "do you know kirtana" → Should search for Kirtana
✅ "ishita ?" → Should search for Ishita
✅ "anything more" → Should show more results if available
✅ "who is the best candidate among all yatri data" → Should search
✅ "any content creators" → Should search for content creators

## Patterns Added

1. **Question patterns**: `do you know X`
2. **Single names with punctuation**: `name ?`
3. **Follow-up variations**: `anything more`
4. **Superlative queries**: `best candidate`, `top yatri`
5. **Profession queries**: `any [profession]`

## Next Steps

If "anything more" still shows "No alumni found", the issue might be:
1. Session not being stored properly for previous search
2. AI filtering out all results when query is vague
3. Session timeout or userId mismatch

Debug by checking:
- Is session being stored after "ishita khond" search?
- Is the same userId being used for retrieval?
- Are results being filtered by AI as irrelevant?
